The python file debug_me does not work properly because it is not taking into account the possibility of a
ZeroDivisionError, which happens in the Result 2.
In that case, c = 3 and d = 3, two variables that will be subtracted from each other, in t1, giving 0.
Later on, t3 will divide t0/t1, and since t1=0, we will get the error.

# CODE:
# --- Find the error!

def g(a, b):
    return a - b

def f(a, b, c, d):
    t0 = a + b - g(a, 0)
    t1 = g(c, d)
    t3 = 2 * (t0 / t1)
    return t0 + 2*t1 + t3*t3

# -- Main program
print("Result 1: ", f(5, 2, 5, 0))
print("Result 2: ", f(0, 2, 3, 3))
print("Result 3: ", f(1, 3, 2, 3))
print("Result 4: ", f(1, 9, 22.0, 3))
